# AgriDefender System Architecture

## Overview

AgriDefender uses a modern, containerized microservices architecture designed for scalability, resilience, and ease of deployment. The system consists of several specialized components that work together to provide a comprehensive solution for biological threat monitoring and prediction.

## System Components

### 1. API Service

The API service is the primary interface for external systems and provides endpoints for data ingestion, querying, and management.

**Key Features:**
- RESTful API built with FastAPI
- Data validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and request throttling
- Swagger documentation

**Technologies:**
- FastAPI
- Pydantic for data validation
- JWT for authentication
- Uvicorn as ASGI server

**Implementation:**
- `src/api/main.py`: Entry point and application configuration
- `src/api/models.py`: Data models and validators
- `src/api/routes/`: Endpoint implementation organized by functionality

### 2. Processing Service

The processing service handles the data processing pipeline, including anomaly detection, threat classification, and alert generation.

**Key Features:**
- Asynchronous data processing
- Anomaly detection for different types of sensor data
- Threat evaluation and classification
- Alert generation based on configurable thresholds

**Technologies:**
- Redis for message queuing
- NumPy and SciPy for scientific computing
- OpenCV for image processing
- Scikit-learn for classical ML algorithms

**Implementation:**
- `src/processing/worker.py`: Main processing worker
- `src/processing/anomaly_detection.py`: Algorithms for detecting anomalies in data
- `src/processing/image_processing.py`: Computer vision for crop image analysis
- `src/processing/geospatial.py`: Geospatial analysis for mapping threats

### 3. Dashboard

The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing data, managing alerts, and analyzing trends.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive data visualization
- Real-time threat monitoring
- Historical data analysis
- User-configurable views and alerts

**Technologies:**
- Streamlit for the web application
- Plotly and Altair for interactive visualizations
- Folium for geospatial mapping
- Pandas for data manipulation

**Implementation:**
- `src/dashboard/app.py`: Main dashboard application
- `src/dashboard/components/`: UI components for different views
- `src/dashboard/api_client.py`: Client for communicating with the API

### 4. Machine Learning Module

The ML module implements predictive models for threat analysis and spread prediction.

**Key Features:**
- LSTM-based spatiotemporal prediction
- Probability heatmap generation
- Model training and evaluation
- Inference optimization for real-time use

**Technologies:**
- TensorFlow for deep learning
- Scikit-learn for traditional ML algorithms
- GeoPandas for geospatial data processing
- Joblib for model serialization

**Implementation:**
- `src/models/spread_prediction.py`: LSTM model for pathogen spread prediction
- `src/models/data_generator.py`: Synthetic data generation for training
- `src/models/model_trainer.py`: Training pipeline
- `src/models/evaluation.py`: Model evaluation and metrics

### 5. Database Layer

The database layer provides persistent storage for sensor data, detected threats, and system configuration.

**Key Features:**
- Relational storage for structured data
- Spatial database for geospatial data
- In-memory caching for performance
- Data partitioning for scalability

**Technologies:**
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
- Redis for caching
- SQLAlchemy as ORM
- Alembic for database migrations

**Implementation:**
- `src/database/`: Database connectivity and management
- `migrations/`: Database migration scripts
- `src/database/models.py`: ORM models

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - External sensors send data to the API service
   - API validates and stores the data in PostgreSQL
   - API enqueues the data for processing

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Processing service dequeues data from Redis
   - Anomaly detection identifies potential threats
   - Threat classification determines type and severity
   - Processing results are stored in the database

3. **Threat Prediction**:
   - ML module loads relevant data for active threats
   - Spread prediction models generate forecasts
   - Results are stored and made available for visualization

4. **Visualization**:
   - Dashboard queries the API for current threats and predictions
   - Data is transformed into interactive visualizations
   - Users interact with the data through the UI

5. **Alerting**:
   - High-severity threats trigger notifications
   - Alerts are sent via configured channels (email, SMS, etc.)
   - Alert status is tracked in the database

## Deployment Architecture

AgriDefender is designed to be deployed as a set of Docker containers orchestrated with Docker Compose:

```
+---------------------------+
| Docker Compose            |
|                           |
| +----------+ +----------+ |
| | API      | |Processing| |
| | Service  | |Service   | |
| +----------+ +----------+ |
|                           |
| +----------+ +----------+ |
| |Dashboard | |Database  | |
| |          | |          | |
| +----------+ +----------+ |
|                           |
| +----------+              |
| |Redis     |              |
| |Cache     |              |
| +----------+              |
+---------------------------+
```

For production deployments, the system can be scaled horizontally by:
- Running multiple API service instances behind a load balancer
- Adding more processing workers
- Using a managed database service
- Implementing a distributed cache

## Security Considerations

AgriDefender implements several security measures:

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for API access
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control for different system functions
3. **Encryption**: TLS for all communications and data at rest encryption
4. **Input Validation
