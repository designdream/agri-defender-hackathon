# Biological Threats to Agriculture

## Viral Threats
- **Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV)**: Infects Nicotiana benthamiana and other crops
- **Strawberry vein banding virus (SVBV)**: Affects strawberry plants, interacts with chlorophyll proteins
- **White spot syndrome virus (WSSV)**: DNA virus affecting crustaceans
- **Acyrthosiphonpisum virus (APV)**: Symbiotic virus in pea aphids that can adapt to host plants
- **Chili leaf curl virus (ChiLCV)**: Begomovirus transmitted by Bemisia tabaci, affects chili cultivation
- **Tomato infectious yellows virus**: Emerging viral disease
- **Lettuce chlorosis virus**: Emerging viral disease
- **High plains virus**: Affects corn crops

## Bacterial Threats
- **Xanthomonas campestris pv. citri**: Causes bacterial canker of citrus
- **Acidovorax avenae subsp. citrulli**: Causes watermelon fruit blotch
- **Other bacterial pathogens**: Various species that could be weaponized against crops

## Fungal Threats
- **Claviceps africana**: Causes sorghum ergot
- **Tilletia indica**: Causes Karnal bunt of wheat
- **Fusarium graminearum**: Causes scab of wheat
- **Synchytrium endobioticum**: Causes potato wart disease, listed as a potential bioterrorism agent
- **Alternaria alternata**: Apple pathotype causing Alternaria leaf blotch

## Transmission Vectors
- **Bemisia tabaci (Whitefly)**: Highly efficient vector for the spread of ChiLCV
- **Other insect vectors**: Various insects that can spread plant diseases

## Bioterrorism Concerns
- Historical evidence of anti-crop weapons development by various nations
- Potential for deliberate introduction of pathogens to disrupt agriculture and food security
- Economic warfare potential through targeting of key crops
- Difficulty in distinguishing natural outbreaks from deliberate attacks
- Vulnerability of modern agricultural systems to biological attacks

## Emerging Threats
- Climate change creating new opportunities for pathogen spread
- International trade and travel facilitating pathogen movement
- Introduction of contaminated seeds
- Release of new germplasm without adequate testing
- Man-made alterations in ecosystems affecting disease dynamics

## Impact on Agriculture
- Significant reduction in crop yields
- Threat to global food security
- Economic losses for farmers and agricultural industries
- Disruption of export markets and trade
- Potential long-term ecological consequences
