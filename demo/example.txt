# AgriDefender Demo Documentation

This file contains examples and demonstrations of the AgriDefender system capabilities.

## Overview

AgriDefender is a comprehensive system for detecting, monitoring, predicting, and responding to biological threats to agriculture. It integrates several innovative research concepts into a unified platform.

## Key Features to Demonstrate

1. **Threat Detection and Monitoring**
   - Sensor data collection and visualization
   - Image-based disease identification
   - Threat mapping and geospatial analysis

2. **Disease Identification**
   - AI Diagnostic Assistant implementation
   - Image upload and analysis
   - Treatment recommendations

3. **Spread Prediction**
   - LSTM-based pathogen spread modeling
   - Temporal-spatial prediction visualization
   - Confidence scoring for predictions

4. **Companion Planting**
   - AI-driven planting recommendations
   - Visualization of planting patterns
   - Compatibility scoring and seasonal guidance

5. **Community Alerts**
   - Geofenced notification system
   - Multi-channel alerts (SMS, email, app)
   - Blockchain verification of reports

## Running the Demo

To start the standalone demo:

```bash
python demo.py
```

For the full application:

```bash
# Start the API server
cd src
python -m api.main

# In a separate terminal, start the dashboard
cd src
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

## Development Notes

The demo implements simplified versions of the full application features using mock data. For production use, refer to the README.md file for complete setup instructions.
